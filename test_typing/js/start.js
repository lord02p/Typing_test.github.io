var exzy_text = `Mental health is crucial and integrates a component of health. Mental healthincludes an individual’s psychological, emotional and social well-being. Propermental health results in the proper mental functioning that result in being productive in activities, healthy and fulfilling relationships with other people and having the ability to cope and adapt to adversity.Proper mental health is essential in every stage of life – from childhood and teenage to adulthood. Throughout a lifetime, an individual can experience mental health issue at any point. This affects not only their mood and behavior but also changes their way of thinking, of looking at life and facing challenges. Even though mental health is a highly personal thing, what affects one person may or may not affect the other person; however, some significant factors contribute to mental health problems. These factors include life experiences such as trauma or abuse, biological factors such as genes or chemistry of the brain, and even the family history of mental health problems can affect an individual. Poor mental health is also linked with stressful work conditions, rapid social changes, gender discrimination, gender discrimination, social exclusion, physical illness and human rights violation.Mental health problems are common, but for the longest time, people have avoided the entire concept of it and taken mental health for granted. At one point, mental health was considered taboo, and anyone seeking help was labelled as mentally ill. Mental health and mental illness are not similar things. For a long time, mental health has been defined as the absence of mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression. Mental illness typically refers to all the diagnosable mental disorders - health conditions that are characterized by alterations in mood, thinking and behavior associated with impaired functioning or distress.Mental health and mental illness together go hand in hand. Individuals having optimal mental health conditions can also face mental illness, where people who have no mental illness can also have poor mental health. In recent times, people have started taking mental health seriously and taking proper steps in dealing with any mental health issues. Help is available out there; people with mental health problems can get better by seeking help.People suffering from mental health issues show various symptoms such as little or no energy, pushing away people and pulling themselves back from regular activities, loss of sleep or the will to eat, smoking, drinking or doing drugs, feeling helpless, yelling and fighting, losing temper very quickly, harming themselves and many more.Taking care of mental health not only is getting help from professionals when needed but also connecting with other, getting involved in physical activities, helping others, getting enough sleep and staying positive that there is a way out. Positive mental health allows people to realize their full potential, cope with stress in life, work productively and make meaningful contributions to the community. Various factors in people’s lives such as intrapersonal relations, physical factors, childhood trauma and many other conditions can disrupt mental health conditions. Taking care and looking after one’s mental health preserves an individual’s ability to enjoy life.`;

Global warmingrefers to the increase in average temperature of earth’s surface during the lastcentury, from 1900-2000. Earth’s surface’s temperature has increased more thanone degree Fahrenheit since 1900. Global warming is alarming because of itsadverse effects on the ecological balance of earth. The resultant ecologicalimbalance, due to global warming, is the root cause of various natural calamitieslike floods, famines, etc. Also it is the root cause of various environmental threatslike increase in sea level, glacier melting, changes in quantity and pattern ofrainfall, heat waves, extreme seasons, etc. This is why global warming is thebuzzword of almost all environmental talks, projects and discussions, etc.Global warming is a threat to the very existence of life on earth. Not only human,but any other form of life, be it flora or fauna face a threat in the face of globalwarming. Hence, it has became the pungent need of the hour to root out thecauses of this threating phenomenon.The most evident causes of global warming are industrialization, urbanization,deforestation, sophisticated human lifestyle and related human activities. Thesehuman activities and trends have led to increased emission of greenhouse gaseslike carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etc. These gases in turn has led toan increase in average temperature of earth’s surface, hence global warming history.Greenhouse effect is a natural process wherein sunlight passes throughatmosphere, warming earth’s surface. Then, the earth’s surface and water bodiesrelease energy in form of heat or infrared radiations into atmosphere andmaintains balance with the incoming energy. Greenhouse gases can absorbsome of the infrared radiation. But increase in greenhouse gases has led to moreabsorption of infrared radiation which in turn has led to the increase of earth’s surface temperature.There is no doubt that the ever increasing phenomenon of global warming wouldlead to a total extinction of any form of life from earth’s face. Global warmingdeplets the ozone layer and might lead us to the doom’s day. It is a wake-up callfor us to amend our ways of living to limit the use of products that contribute tothe increase in global warming. For our sake and for existence of all life on ourheavenly planet earth, it is the need of the hour that we make sincere efforts andattempts to contain the monster called ‘global warming’`;

var hard_text = `Introduction: Martin Luther King Jr. in one of his letters from Birmingham prison said that through painful experience alone we can know that freedom is not something that is freely given. The ones who do not have it, must demand it. It shows his grit and perseverance even in the face of opposition. King was a civil rights activist for the Afro-American people. Never forgetting his ideals and principles of non-violence, he fought for the freedom of his people. His leadership was pivotal in legally putting an end to racial segregation in America. Childhood: Racism was something that he was acutely aware of as he grew up. Right from the age of six, his friendship with a white boy was taken away when his parents decided that they did not want their son to associate with a black boy. His father played a significant role in educating King about the long history of oppression and racism that his people had faced in America for years. His father was also someone who took a stand against segregation and discrimination when he could. Something that King watched that left a deep impression upon him.Adolescence: Growing older, King began to hate the whites for the racism hehad seen and gone through. He also began to stray from what he had learned inhis Baptist upbringing. The oratory skills that King would later be famous forbegan to bloom around his adolescence. The very first speech that he gave wasin his junior year. He said that the black Americans still wear chains, thoughslavery was abolished years ago. Even a highly esteemed black man is stillinferior to the cruelest white man. On his ride home with his teacher on the bus,he was ordered by the driver to stand to let the white passengers sit down. Herefused to until his teacher said that he should do what was told, as he would bebreaking the law otherwise. When he wrote of the bus ride, he recorded that itwas the angriest he had ever been.King spent all his childhood in a segregated neighborhood and had a chance tosee the opposite in Connecticut. He came to Morehouse here for his freshmanyear and had an opportunity to see things from a new perspective. Here was alsowhere King reconciled with his Baptist upbringing. He graduated in 1948 with aBachelor of Arts from Morehouse.Marriage and Ministry: In 1953, he married Coretta Scott and were parents tofour children, Yolanda King, Martin Luther King III, Dexter Scott King, andBernice King. It was also in the 1950s that his activism began, which hecontinued till his death.King became the pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Alabama in1954. He was also a member of the executive committee of the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People.Activism: In 1955, Claudette Corvin and Rosa Parks refused to give up theirseats for white people on the bus in separate incidents. This sparked off theMontgomery bus boycott that King led. It lasted for 385, during which King’shouse was bombed. He was arrested as well, but this incident resulted inremoving segregation on public buses in Montgomery. This boycott launchedKing into a national figure and spokesman for the movement against racialdiscrimination.With other civil rights activists, King came together and founded the SouthernChristian Leadership Conference in 1957. Among other purposes, this group wasto organize non-violent protests and movements in their pursuit of ensuring civilrights for all, regardless of race. King was a leader of the SCLC till his death.Governmental Opposition: While he found favor in some officials’ eyes, he puthimself squarely in opposition to the President when he spoke against the war inVietnam. King not only fought for his people but spoke out against all injusticewhenever he could. He was also branded a communist by the FBI and was underconstant surveillance. So much so that when he was assassinated, it wasspeculated whether it was the work of just one man or King’s death was a part ofa bigger conspiracy.Death: James Earl Ray was the man who ended King’s long fight against racialdiscrimination. King was fatally shot, and not even surgery could save him. Hisdeath caused nationwide rioting, which took great effort to put an end to.`;
